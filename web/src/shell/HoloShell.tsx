      {/* `relative z-10` here is what keeps UserMenu's dropdown visible. The
          dropdown hangs out of this header and over <main>, which comes LATER in
          the document and whose panels create stacking contexts of their own
          (every GlassPanel carries backdrop-blur), so at z-auto the page content
          paints over the open menu. The z-index has to be declared out HERE, on
          the header, not on the dropdown: this header's own backdrop-blur makes
          it a stacking context, which confines any z-index inside it. Measured
          in Chrome over 275 hit-test points across the open dropdown - with the
          dropdown's own z-50 and nothing else, 220 of them still returned a page
          panel; with `z-10` here and no z-index on the dropdown at all, 0 did.

          `relative z-0` on <main> does NOT fix today's bug (z-10 alone measured
          0/275 with <main> untouched). It is a guard on the next one: it wraps
          every descendant z-index in one stacking context, so a page-level
          z-index can never climb over the header. Measured the same way with a
          `relative z-20` added to a page panel - 99/275 occluded without this
          class, 0 with it.

          Dialogs are unaffected either way: they portal to a layer appended to
          <body>, outside both siblings, and keep their z-50 above them. */}
